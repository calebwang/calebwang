  p
    | Hi, I'm Caleb.
  p 
    | I'm currently a junior at the University of California, Berkeley,
    | majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 
    | and I'm also currently a TA for 
    a(href='http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b') CS 61B
    | . Over the summer of 2013, I interned as a software engineer at 
    a(href='http://www.linkedin.com') LinkedIn
    |. I also worked as a research assistant at the 
    a(href='http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu') Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute 
    | last school year, and I'm also involved with 
    a(href='http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu') Eta Kappa Nu 
    | as a student relations officer. 
    | I also occasionally attend class when the mood strikes me. 
  p 
    | My primary academic interests are in computer science theory 
    | and artificial intelligence, 
    | and I am also capable of developing on the entire stack. 
    | Other topics that interest me are math, physics, and education. 
  p
    | I mostly spend my spare time by amusing myself with
    | a variety of inane activities. As for interests that other people can relate to,
    | I also enjoy biking, drinking green tea, dining at 
    a(href='http://www.kfc.com') fine 
    a(href='http://www.innout.com') restaurants
    |, and having heated arguments on topics I know nothing about.
