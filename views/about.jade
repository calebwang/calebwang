  p
    | Hi, I'm Caleb.
  p 
    | I'm currently a junior at the University of California, Berkeley,
    | majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. 
    | Over the summer of 2013, I interned as a software engineer at 
    a(href='http://www.linkedin.com') LinkedIn
    |. I also worked as a research assistant at the 
    a(href='http://neuroscience.berkeley.edu') Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute 
    | last school year, and I'm also involved with 
    a(href='http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu') Eta Kappa Nu 
    | as a student relations officer. 
    | I also occasionally attend class when the mood strikes me. 
  p 
    | My primary academic interests are in computer science theory 
    | and artificial intelligence, 
    | and I am also capable of developing on the entire stack. 
    | I also keep tabs on developments in several other fields; 
    | math, physics, and cognitive science, to name a few. 
  p
    | In my spare time, I enjoy biking, drinking green tea, dining at 
    a(href='http://www.kfc.com') fine 
    a(href='http://www.innout.com') restaurants
    |, and having heated arguments on topics I know nothing about.
