i just hacked together this website in a couple of days, starting basically from zero experience making webapps. of course, you don't really need any when you use node, and i'm not particularly proud of the design part either; it's quite ghetto, but it'll suffice for now. it's not like i'm "really" hosting this anywhere anyways; it's only on heroku so i don't have to always locally run my node app, but i guess that's a good enough reason to get rid of the 'sample' blogs i had before and post some content!

merry christmas/happy holidays to everyone!
let's hope i decide not to be lazy and put some effort into making this site better/registering a domain.
