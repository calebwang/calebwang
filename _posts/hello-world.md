i just hacked together this website in a couple of days, starting basically from zero knowledge of node, js, html, or css. of course, you don't really have to "learn" html or css, but still. i'm not particularly proud of the design; it's pretty ghetto, quite honestly, but it'll suffice for now. it's not like i'm even hosting this on my own domain or anything; it's only on heroku so i don't have to always locally run my node app, but i guess that's a good enough reason to get rid of the 'sample' blogs i had before and post some content!

merry christmas/happy holidays!
